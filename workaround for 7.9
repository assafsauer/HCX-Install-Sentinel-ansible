Here are the steps to be followed for the workaround:
1.       Login to SDR
a.       Login to cloud-manager using “ssh admin@<cloud-manager>”
b.       Run “ccli”
c.       List the appliances and get the id of SDR “list”
d.       Load the SDR context “go <sdr-id>”
e.       Ssh to SDR “ssh”
 
2.       Create a folder for 7.9 and create a symlink to 7/7/bin by running the following commands:
 
mkdir -p /opt/vmware/sdr-tools/centos/7/9
chmod 0755 /opt/vmware/sdr-tools/centos/7/9
cd /opt/vmware/sdr-tools/centos/7/9
ln -s ../7/bin bin
 
3.       Make sure the symlink lists all the files under 7/9/bin
 
ls -l /opt/vmware/sdr-tools/centos/7/9/
ls -l /opt/vmware/sdr-tools/centos/7/9/bin/
